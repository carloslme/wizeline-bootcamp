# First Deliverable 
(due October 24th, 11:59 PM)

Based on the self-study material, recorded and live session, and mentorship covered until this deliverable, we suggest you perform the following:
*  Take as reference Terraform reference, identify and select the corresponding terraform blocks to build your own Airflow Cluster.
*  Airflow Cluster must be built with GKS in Google or EKS in AWS.
*  In case of some difficulties, take advantage of templates provided by Wizeline to build and start your Airflow Cluster.
* Take your notes about any blocker and your lessons learned to be discussed during Q&A and Mentoring sessions.

## Outcome:
* Terraform blocks to build and run your Airflow Cluster.
* (Optional) Automation process to run Terraform blocks as part of the main Data Pipeline

## Notes: 
* What has been listed in this deliverable is just for guidance and to help you distribute your workload; you can deliver more or fewer items if necessary. However, if you deliver fewer items at this point, you have to cover the remaining tasks in the next deliverable.
* Your mentor will post the feedback comments on your mentoring session. For reference, take a look at the DE Bootcamp calendar.
