    "Based on the self-study material, recorded and live session, and mentorship covered until this deliverable, we suggest you perform the following:\n",

    "* Take as reference Terraform reference, identify and select the corresponding terraform blocks to build your own Airflow Cluster.\n",
    "* Airflow Cluster must be built with GKS in Google or EKS in AWS.\n",
    "* In case of some difficulties, take advantage of templates provided by Wizeline to build and start your Airflow Cluster.\n",
    "* Take your notes about any blocker and your lessons learned to be discussed during Q&A and Mentoring sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outcome:**\n",
    "* Terraform blocks to build and run your Airflow Cluster.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Notes:**\n",
    "* What has been listed in this deliverable is just for guidance and to help you distribute your workload; you can deliver more or fewer items if necessary. However, if you deliver fewer items at this point, you have to cover the remaining tasks in the next deliverable.\n",
    "* Your mentor will post the feedback comments on your mentoring session. For reference, take a look at the DE Bootcamp calendar."
